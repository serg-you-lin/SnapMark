# SnapMark

SnapMark is a Python library for applying intelligent, customizable text markings and engraving paths on DXF (AutoCAD) files.
It is designed to generate laser-engraving traces (not cutting paths) that make each part identifiable through incised labels, codes, and metadata. 
Built on top of the excellent [`ezdxf`](https://ezdxf.mozman.at/), it provides a simple API for marking, alignment, hole analysis, and batch processing — tailored for manufacturing, CNC workflows, and automated drawing preparation.

## ⚠️ Unit & Scale Notice

SnapMark is designed for sheet-metal parts measured in millimeters.

Since DXF files may contain arbitrary units (meters, inches, kilometers, or undefined scale), loading a drawing in a different unit system may produce text markings that appear extremely large, extremely small, or misplaced.

If your DXF is not in millimeters, you must rescale it before processing, or the resulting engraving paths may not match the actual geometry.

A scale-validation step will be added in a future release to automatically warn users when a drawing appears to be out of the expected millimeter range.


## Installation
```bash
pip install snapmark
```

## Quick Start
```python
import snapmark as sm

# Mark all DXF files with their filename
sm.mark_by_name("path/to/drawings")

# Custom sequence: filename + folder name
seq = (sm.SequenceBuilder()
       .file_name()
       .folder(num_chars=2)   # firts 2 chars of folder name
       .build())

sm.mark_with_sequence("path/to/drawings", seq, scale_factor=100)
```

## Features

- ✅ **Simple API** - Mark files in a single function call
- ✅ **Custom sequences** - Combine filename parts, folder names, literals, and custom logic
- ✅ **Automatic Alignment** - Normalize orientation before marking
- ✅ **Batch Processing** - Process folders and subfolders with IterationManager
- ✅ **Backup System** - Automatic .bak creation and restoration
- ✅ **Hole Utilities** - Fast hole detection and counting for quality checks
- ✅ **Extensible Architecture** - Add your own operations and processing steps

## Use Cases

- **Manufacturing**: Add part numbers and quantities to production drawings
- **CAM workflows**: Automatically mark drawings before CNC processing
- **Quality control**: Count holes and verify drawing specifications
- **Batch processing**: Apply consistent markings across large drawing sets

## API Overview (Essentials)

### Shortcuts (Simple Usage)

- `mark_by_name(folder)` - Mark with filename
- `mark_by_splitted_text(folder, separator, part_index)` - Mark with filename part
- `mark_with_sequence(folder, sequence)` - Mark with custom sequence
- `quick_count_holes(folder, min_diam, max_diam)` - Count holes
- `restore_backup(folder)` - Restore from backups
- `process_single_file(file, *operations)` - Pipeline on single file


### SequenceBuilder (core)

```python
seq = (sm.SequenceBuilder()
       .file_name()
       .file_part(separator="_", index=0)
       .folder(num_chars=2)
       .literal("TEXT")
       .custom(lambda folder, file: "X")
       .set_separator("-")
       .build())
```

### Operations (Advanced)

- `AddMark(sequence)` - Add text marking
- `Aligner()` - Aligns the drawing along its longest side in the X direction.
- `CountHoles(find_func)` - Count circles
- `AddX(find_func, x_size)` - Add X marks
- `RemoveCircle(find_func)` - Remove circles
- `SubstituteCircle(find_func, new_radius)` - Replace circles
